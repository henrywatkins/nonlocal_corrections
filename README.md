# Nonlocal corrections calculation

This repository holds scripts for the numerical calculation of the corrections to linear-regime MHD magnetized transport coefficients. It accompanies the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05450.

The repository consists of

1. old_nonlocal_calculation_script: used for a previous draft and uses a different method for calculation
2. nonlocal_calc: a jupyter notebook with the up-to-date method for calculation.
